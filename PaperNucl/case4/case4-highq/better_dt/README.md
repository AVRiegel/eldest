Same as before, but with better time resolution, i. e. time step of 0.125 fs instead of 0.5 fs:

Like Fig. 8 in the nuclear paper, but with the unaltered potentials of case 4 (#4 in Table 1).
I. e. normal case 4, but with q = 10 instead of 1.
dEres = 0.241 eV = 17.2 fs
tau0 = 111.93 fs, tau1 = 37.67 fs

FFT at Ekin = 10.11 eV
Ekin to 0<-0 = 37.60 fs = 0.11 eV, Ekin to 0<-1 = 31.57 fs = 0.14 eV

Peaks:
a1) 26.993 THz (at 2.105e-06 arb. u.) = 37.05 fs = 0.11 eV
a2) 31.992 THz (at 1.735e-06 arb. u.) = 31.26 fs = 0.13 eV
b) 56.986 THz (at 5.946e-07 arb. u.) = 17.246 fs = 0.24 eV

Centre of FWHM with HWHM as uncertainty:
a) The FWHM of peak a1 spans both peaks a1 and a2. If they are treated as one mountain with two peaks, FWHM is:
   25.529 … 34.638 THz -> (30.084 ± 4.555) THz = (33.24 ± 5.03) fs = (0.124 ± 0.019) eV
   If one uses the minimum between a1 and a2 (the col, if one likes) at 28.993 THz, 1.381e-06 as reference,
   the peak prominences are 7.247e-07 and 3.540e-07 arb. u., resp.
   FWHM w. r. t. the col (i. e. within peak prominences) are:
a1) 26.463 … 27.610 THz -> (27.037 ± 0.574) THz = (36.99 ± 0.78) fs = (0.112 ± 0.002) eV
a2) 30.336 … 32.744 THz -> (31.540 ± 1.204) THz = (31.71 ± 1.21) fs = (0.130 ± 0.005) eV
b) The half-maximum intensity is not reached on the left side of the peak,
   because of the ensuing peak a(2) on the left. If one uses the minimum between them (the col, if one likes)
   at 47.988 THz at 3.911e-07 arb. u., which yields a peak prominence of 2.035e-07 arb. u.,
   FWHM w. r. t. the col (i. e. within peak prominence) is:
   54.502 … 59.338 THz -> (56.920 ± 2.418) THz = (17.57 ± 0.75) fs = (0.235 ± 0.010) eV
